# SneakOnBy

Paints the aggression zones around monsters in Deep Dungeons. Supports proximity, sound, and sight based monsters.

Requires [DeepDungeonDex](https://github.com/wolfcomp/DeepDungeonDex) to be installed as well.

## Usage

Install with custom repo `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/McSwindler/DalamudPlugins/main/repo.json`

Use command `/sneaky` to configure options.

Still a work in progress.
